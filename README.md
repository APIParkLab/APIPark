<b>ü¶Ñ APIPark is an open-source, all-in-one AI gateway and API developer portal, helping developers and enterprises easily manage, integrate, and deploy AI services. APIPark is open-sourced under the Apache 2.0 license, which means it's free for commercial use!</b>

<br>

‚ú® With APIPark, you can:
1. Quickly connect to 100+ AI models, supporting all mainstream AI Companies!
2. Combine AI models and prompt templates into APIs, such as creating a sentiment analysis API, translation API, or data analysis API based on OpenAI GPT-4 and some custom prompts.
3. Standardize the data format of all AI API requests, so switching AI models or modifying prompts won‚Äôt affect your APP or microservices, simplifying your AI usage and maintenance costs.
4. Share APIs within the team through APIPark's developer portal.
5. Manage calling applications and API keys to ensure your API's security and stability.
6. Monitor your AI API usage with clear charts.

<br>

‚ú® APIPark is also a powerful cloud-native API gateway:
1. It outperforms Nginx with higher performance, supports cluster deployment, and handles large-scale traffic.
2. Share REST APIs within the team, manage API call relationships, and prevent management costs and data breaches caused by chaotic API calls.


<br>

# üíå Why Did We Build APIPark?
Before building APIPark, we spent seven years developing an API development and automated testing platform with over 1 million developer users, 500+ enterprise customers, and multi-million-dollar investment from Sequoia Capital.

As AI and Agents evolved, we noticed many enterprises wanted to integrate AI into both internal and third-party APIs, enabling AI agents to perform more complex tasks beyond being just knowledge-based Q&A bots. Hence, we built APIPark‚Äîyour all-in-one AI gateway and API developer portal to accelerate your AI API development and quickly build your product or AI agent!

<br>

# ‚ú® Quick Start
APIPark is designed to solve the following problems:
- Seamlessly connect to various AI models and package these AI capabilities into APIs for easy calling, significantly reducing the barrier to using AI models.
- Manage complex AI & API call relationships.
- Manage API creation, monitoring, and security.
- Fault detection and troubleshooting: Simplifying system issue identification and resolution.
- Quantify data asset value: Enhance the visibility and valuation of data assets.

<br>

üòç Deploying APIPark is incredibly simple. With just one command line, you can deploy your AI gateway and API developer portal in under 5 minutes.

```
curl -sSO  https://download.apipark.com/install/quick-start.sh ;  bash quick-start.sh
```

# üö© Roadmap
We‚Äôve set exciting goals for APIPark: enabling everyone to quickly create their own products and AI agents using AI and APIs!

To achieve this goal, we plan to add new features to APIPark, including:
1. Integrating with API marketplaces such as Postman, RapidAPI, APISpace, APILayer, etc. You can directly use APIs from various API marketplaces through APIPark and make them smarter using AI.
2. Integrating AI Agents such as Langchain, AgentGPT, Auto-GPT, Dify, and more, allowing AI Agents to access your internal or third-party APIs through APIPark to complete more complex tasks.
3. Intelligent API orchestration: APIPark will provide a unified API entry point and automatically orchestrate multiple APIs to fulfill your requests based on the API content.
